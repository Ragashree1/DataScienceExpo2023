# Recipe Recommendation System using Flask and NLP

This is a web-based Recipe Recommendation System built using Flask, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and cosine similarity. The application provides recipe recommendations based on user-input recipe titles and ingredient similarities.

## Features

- Enter a recipe title, and the system will recommend similar recipes.
- The recommendations are based on ingredient similarity calculated using cosine similarity.
- A dataset of recipes is used to provide recommendations.
- Front-end is built with HTML forms, and Flask handles the backend logic.
